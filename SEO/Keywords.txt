The Future of SEO 2020 And Beyond

2019 has been full of wins and losses for us SEOs. Multiple announced and some unconfirmed algorithm updates have kept us on our toes and made us adapt accordingly. These updates steadily shape how Google will process search in the years to come and we want you, our readers, to be ready and stay ahead of the game this 2020. SEO is an ever-changing industry and we should be in-the-know about the most recent updates and we should also possess a mastery of the past updates that happened. The SEO landscape is very dynamic. Sure, some things stay the same: put relevant keywords in your titles, make it a priority to optimize for mobile users, etc.

But other things continue changing in a never-ending spiral. This year, Google, along with other huge platforms, is trying more and more to be the end destination of their users’ journeys.

This, more than anything, defines major SEO trends for 2020, since now we need to find the best ways to stay effective within the framework created by Google.
